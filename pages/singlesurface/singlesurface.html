      <div class="grid-item">Eugenie & I were invited to do an exhibition at the sadly now closed Offshoot Gallery in North London. Our collaboration began from photographs I took of wooden blocks, which we used as "building blocks" in our collages. Our work is the large metal sheet/magnet collage on the wall; Eugenie made the framed pieces and I made the long table books. We decided to invite some friends to exhibit with us, and so I also had to decide how to lay out Kitagawa's multicolour "Fur" grid, and did so by arranging print colours in an <moji>L</moji> shape like how a knight moves in chess.
