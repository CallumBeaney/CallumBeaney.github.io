          This I made from pictures of wooden blocks and their shadows. At some point I decided to create glyphs out of the shapes following some simple design rules. Then I drew those in chalk, and photographed them. Then I made a basic grammar system with those glyphs, purely to describe a single construction I made where the blocks form a square shadow.
          <br><br>
          Later on I made a book out of just the glyphs you see here, even the ones that never got used. It was exhibited at <a href="https://callumbeaney.github.io/pages/singlesurface/singlesurface.html" style="color: cornflowerblue;">Single Surface</a> on a table.
          <br><br>
          My friend <a href="https://www.instagram.com/josefball/" style="color:crimson;">Joe</a> printed them for me on some old off-white paper I found somewhere. They are joined  with wet-activated mounting/hinging tape. I do not recommend trying to bind books in this manner. 
          <br><br>
          Though I read and thought about some stuff when making it, I don't really have any specific deeper meaning to give you about this work.
