            Lucky was my best friend for the better part of ten years. I don’t remember when he died. It was a year or two ago.
          </p>

          <p>
            When they go blind, some cats regress back to a more kitten-like stage. Lucky slowly lost his vision over a number of years. First, he suffered a loss to an unknown assailant shortly after taking a light hit from a car one halloween. The eye almost bisected, we found him sitting on the stairs in silence following a few days’ absence. A purebred, the fur of him a sunless black, he was especially prone to infection, and so rather than suffering the immediate loss or eternal absence of most his vision faded gradually, as though in preparation. 
          </p>
          
          <img class="catimg vert" src="./img/photo1.jpg">
          
          <p>
            By the time he was fully blind he’d adjusted, whiling away his days sunning himself in the garden or curled upon our beds and occasionally irritated—but also somewhat comforted—by the presence of the third cat, who would also develop cancer. All three died from a dose of anaesthetic. The time we came to see off the first, I’d asked the veterinarian what was used to kill them. Lucky was the second. I didn’t go to see the third die.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Lucky could hardly be seen in most pictures. His fur consumed the light around him, rendering all but the most extreme overexposure inviable. The world inside the photograph would glow, light blooming around his illuminated form as though he were a shade traversing the aether. Even with a single extant print from when we picked him up that night I don’t in my mind remember his old face, and with no help of golden irises to hold his face in place I can only grasp his orientation or vague direction of interest in those old prints and files now. 
          </p>

          <p>
            I remember his gait, the way the head would bob slightly, employing some sensory check of the space immediately preceding him before continuing on. A low, rumbling drone upon recognition of his companions. He had only adoration for anybody who would offer him their hand.	
          </p>

          <br>
          <img class="catimg horz" src="./img/photo3.jpg">
          <img class="catimg horz" src="./img/photo4.jpg">
          <br>

          <p>
            At the moment Lucky died I felt nothing. He became more like his pictures, became an object possessed of nothing but its shape. 
            The five to ten minutes preceding the injection went slow:  building pressure in my chest, grief tearing at the muscles, grimaced in strange contortions, unable to breathe through the nose. The anticipation tipped somewhat off balance by warm purring and curiosity for this strange new space so different in timbre texture and scent to the small regions Lucky had become accustomed to in his past life.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            He circled around our feet and the yellow walls of the small cube, knocking once or twice head first into the steel leg of the table (but slowly, as he’d learned to move). We hoisted him upon it, and, used to being manhandled, his only interest was to offer more affection. I watched and felt him slowly limpen as the sedative overwhelmed his system, shut down his lungs, black fur gently squashing into the cool metal, some tiny degree of body heat surely transferring onto the surface as he lay there pressed against it.
          </p>

          <p>
            Though the nurse warned he might, he never soiled himself.
          </p>
          
          <img class="catimg vert" src="./img/photo2.jpg">

          <p>
            Between the moment he began to fall asleep and the moments later when he stopped breathing, whatever the thing I had thought Lucky to be had disappeared. I stroked his fur and I felt his paws with the pads of my fingers, feeling the thin bones and claws they held in place and spending a long time watching the body from my stool, hunched over and resting my chin next to it like I could never see him well close enough. My mother left shortly after the veterinarian. 
          </p>
          
          <p>
            At the time I was confused by this reaction of mine, and for a long while just I sat there almost narrating that experience to myself—that feeling of staring at my dear friend—in my mind in a long silence eventually broken by the nurse's gentle explanation that soon, you too must leave for the next.
          </p>

          <p>
            He’d been brought to the door one evening by a woman I only heard but never saw offer. From the hall, mother entered, asking “would you like a cat? There’s a lady giving them away”.

            I wanted to try writing short stories, to pair with pictures. I saw some advice from some famous author that you "should write what you know", and I knew my cat. <br><br> I had intended to write more, but found as it got to about 700 words that this was sufficient. Eventually I may make a small edition on bible paper, folded in a traditional Chinese stab bound book.
